# Yantio'

Yantio' is the first project developed by the company Embedded System Solution, it consists of an encryption and decryption machine using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) known as Rinjdael. This project must be implemented in a **DIGILENT** family FPGA.

This is the monorepo of Yantio', it contains the verilog project, the ease diagram, and the main documentation 

***WARNING*** 

The development of this project is only available for use in an FPGA Nexys 3.

##**Description**

Today, we are highly dependent on technology, which is why we need our information to be transmitted securely, as our high-value data is in danger of falling into the wrong hands and our information can be used incorrectly and without our consent. affecting our personal integrity. With this goal in mind, we developed our pioneering project: Yantio’.

Yantio' is the first project developed by the company Embedded System Solution, it consists of an encryption and decryption machine using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) known as Rinjdael, following a 128-bit length key protocol with 10 rounds of encryption.. This project must be implemented in a DIGILENT family FPGA.

For now, the development of this project is only available for use in an FPGA Nexys 3. However, we hope in the future to continue with the project so that it can be implemented in other FPGAs in the family, such as Basis 2 or Basis 3.
## **Objective**
The goal of the program is to protect user information by creating a more secure transmission for your data, and to demonstrate that it can be deployed in more complex modules by using FPGAs. This approach was chosen, since the use of this tool in communication is very high today, thanks to its speed and low costs.

## **License and credits**
The Design Software and the Nexys 3 FPGA board was development by Xilink Company and Digilent Company

The project was developed by the students of the Embedded Systems Class Period February - June 2021 of the Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM) Campus Queretaro.

The manuals of the board provided are owned by Xilink Company and Digilent Company

The development and creation of this project is exclusively academic, so the use of this is only to disseminate the possible applications of Verilog in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA).

OUR PURPOSE IS NOT FOR PROFIT

In case of making use of this program, please give credit to the developers of the project.

# Yantio'

Yantio' is the first project developed by the company Embedded System Solution, it consists of an encryption and decryption machine using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) known as Rinjdael. This project must be implemented in a **DIGILENT** family FPGA.

This is the monorepo of Yantio', it contains the verilog project and the ease diagram

***WARNING*** 

The development of this project is only available for use in an FPGA Nexys 3.

The Design Software and the Nexys 3 FPGA board was development by [Xilink Company](https://www.xilinx.com/) and [Digilent Company](https://store.digilentinc.com/)

The Proyect were development by the students of the Embedded Systems Class Period February - June 2021 of the Instituto Tecnol√≥gico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM) Campus Queretaro.
  
The manuals of the board provided are owned by [Xilink Company](https://www.xilinx.com/) and [Digilent Company](https://store.digilentinc.com/)
  
The development and creation of this project is exclusively academic, so the use of this is only to disseminate the possible applications of Verilog in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA).

OUR PURPOSE IS NOT FOR PROFIT
 
In case of making use of this program, please give credit to the developers of the project.
